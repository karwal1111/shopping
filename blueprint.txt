Here are a few approaches you can consider to connect C++ code with web development:

Web APIs: Create a web API (Application Programming Interface) in C++ that exposes endpoints for the web application to interact with. The web application can send HTTP requests to these endpoints, and the C++ code can process the requests and return responses. Commonly used libraries for creating web APIs in C++ include Boost.Beast, Pistache, and Crow.

Wrappers and Interprocess Communication: Write wrapper functions or libraries around your existing C++ code that expose a C API (Application Programming Interface). Then, use interprocess communication mechanisms like shared memory, pipes, or sockets to communicate between the web application and the C++ code. The web application can call the wrapper functions to interact with the C++ code.

WebAssembly: Compile your C++ code to WebAssembly (Wasm), which is a binary instruction format that can be executed by modern web browsers. By converting your C++ code to Wasm, you can run it directly in the web application's browser environment. You can use tools like Emscripten to compile C++ to Wasm.

Microservices Architecture: Build your web application as a separate component or microservice that communicates with a C++ microservice. The web application can send requests to the C++ microservice via interprocess communication, message queues, or network protocols like REST or gRPC.

The choice of approach depends on various factors such as your project requirements, existing codebase, performance needs, and available tools. It's important to evaluate these factors and choose the approach that best suits your specific use case.

Additionally, keep in mind that connecting C++ code with web development often involves considerations such as data serialization (converting data between C++ objects and web-friendly formats like JSON or XML), error handling, security, and performance optimizations.
